# 🏠 HOUSE OF PIZZA  
## 🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project  
*A complete end-to-end SQL analysis of a full year of pizza sales data using MySQL.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **guided SQL analysis case study**, where I solved all essential business questions and additionally added few SQL queries from my end.
This project analyzes **48,620 order line items**, spanning **21,350 orders** over a full year, for a fictional pizza store — **House of Pizza**.  
Using MySQL, I performed:

- Data Exploration & Validation  
- Data Cleaning  
- KPI Development  
- Business Analysis  
- Advanced SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Ranking)  
- Insight Generation  

The objective is to understand **customer behavior**, **high-performing products**, **revenue trends**, and **operational patterns**.

This project demonstrates strong SQL skills and the ability to translate data into **clear business recommendations**.

## 🗂 Database Setup

### 📌 Create Database  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE houseofpizza;
USE houseofpizza;
```

### 📌 Data Import
- `pizzas.csv` & `pizza_types.csv` imported using  
  **Table Data Import Wizard** → Create new table → Verify data types → Import.

- For `orders` and `order_details`, tables were created first:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_details (
    order_details_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    pizza_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(order_details_id)
);
```
Then CSV files were imported into these tables using **Import Wizard**.

---

## 🧪 Data Cleaning & Validation  
Before analysis, the following checks were performed:

✔ No null values in key fields  
✔ No negative or zero prices  
✔ No invalid quantities  
✔ All orders had matching order_details  
✔ Sizes standardized (S, M, L, XL, XXL)  

Dataset is **clean, complete, and ready for analysis**.
